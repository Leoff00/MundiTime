# The Project

This is a project to show the time in some places in the Earth,
currently I only made the style of the page, after I'll apply funcionality to this project.

#

# Why i made this
This is a personal project to get a large knowledge about
new technologies that I don't use often, I believe that
we can learn more with this way.
